title: Context Sensitive Help
description: Welcome brave explorer to the Bulk Delete context sensitive help page. You most likely navigated to this page by clicking the help icon in Business Central (the one that looks like a question mark) and then clicking a link under the About apps on this page section. If the page you were looking at has a special topic dedicated to that page, you will have been taken straight to that topic heading when you clicked the link. If there is no dedicated help topic for the page you were on, you will have been shown the top of this page and will be reading this text, probably wondering why you are here, and what it was you were trying to do before you arrived.
